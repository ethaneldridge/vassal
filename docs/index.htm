<p>VASSAL is not a graphics or paint program.  We leave that to the experts. 
 VASSAL uses imported artwork in GIF format, which you must have created beforehand
using your favorite graphics program. In most cases, this means creating
images for the maps, counters, and charts.  </p>
 
<p>A good free tool for making VASSAL counters is the button-making utility 
<a href="http://www.steffengerlach.de/freeware">ZPaint</a>  </p>
 
<p>The most popular program for drawing maps is <a
 href="http://www.jasc.com">Paint Shop Pro</a>. &nbsp;However, an interesting
utility for creating maps is <a href="http://www.realmcreator.com">Realm
Creator</a>. </p>
 
<p>For each tutorial, there is a data directory containing all necessary
artwork so that you can work through the tutorial. </p>
 
<h2 align="left"><b>Launching the editor</b> </h2>
 
<p>Launch the VASSAL module editor. </p>
 
<p align="center"><img src="images/welcome.gif" nosave="" border="0"
 height="195" width="269" alt="">
  </p>
 
<p>Click on "New Module" to begin a new module. You will see two new windows
 come up. One is the main control window for playing a game. &nbsp;Theother 
is the editing window, where you will do the work of creating your module. 
As you create the module, you can start new games, move pieces, save, etc. 
just as if you were playing the module. This allows you to test your module 
as you create it. Save the module periodically with the "Save" button n the 
edit window toolbar as you progress. &nbsp;You may also access the <a
 href="../ReferenceManual/index.htm">Reference Manual</a> from the edit window 
toolbar. </p>
 
<p align="center"><img src="images/configureWindow.gif" nosave=""
 border="0" height="240" width="254" alt="">
  </p>
 
<p>The editing window has a standard folder-and-file browser interface. Each 
component in the tree represents a component of the module. The text for the
node gives the name of the module followed by the type of that component in
square brackets. The top level represents the module itself. By default, the
module contains one Map window, one Game Piece Palette and one Help Menu. 
&nbsp;Every component in the edit window has a right-click menu.</p>
 
<p><b></b>The first step in creating a new module is to name it.&nbsp; Right-click 
on the module component and select "Properties" &nbsp;Alternatively, double-click 
on it.. You'll be presented with a window in which you may set the name and 
a version number for the module.<br>
