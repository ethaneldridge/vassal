<p>In this tutorial, we will go through the steps for making a module that
 allows for double-blind play, in which a referee <br>
 determines what each of the two players will see on their map.&nbsp; The 
module data is in BlindTopData and the finished module is BlindTop.mod. </p>
 
<p><a name="sides"></a><b>Defining the Sides</b> </p>
 
<p>Our module will take two players: a referee, a US player, and a Japanese
 player.&nbsp; In the Configuration Window, double-click on the node named
 "[Definition of Player Sides]."&nbsp; Enter "Referee,"&nbsp; "USA," and
"IJN" into the properties window and hit "Ok." <br>

<p><a name="windows"></a><b>Private Windows</b> </p>
 
<p>The key to a double-blind game are Private Windows, which can be configured
 to only appear to certain players.&nbsp; We will make two Private Windows:&nbsp;
 one for the USA player and one for the IJN.&nbsp; Each player will see only 
his own map and the Referee will see both.&nbsp; Right-click on the "[Module]" 
node and select "Add Private Window."&nbsp; For "Belongs to side" enter "Referee" 
and "USA," and name the map "USA Map."&nbsp; Expand the "USA Map" node, right-click 
on "Map Boards" and select "Add Board."&nbsp; Hit the "Select" button and 
pick BlindTopMap.gif.&nbsp; Then right-click on the "[Module]" node again 
and add another Private Window.&nbsp; For "Belongs to side" enter "Referee" 
and "IJN."&nbsp; For "Use same boards as this map" enter "USA Map," and name 
the map "IJN Map." <br>

     <tr>

  </tr>
     
  </tbody> 
</table>
   </p>
 
<p><a name="pieces"></a><b>The Pieces</b> </p>
 
<p>For counters, we'll use a pair of simple pieces that can be made invisible.&nbsp;
 Right-cick on the "[Game Piece Palette]" node and select "Add Panel."&nbsp;
 Right-click on the "[Panel]" node and select "Add Single Piece."&nbsp; Hit 
"Properties" and select "ALLIED_CF.gif" for the image.&nbsp; Also add the 
"Can be Invisible" trait.&nbsp; Clone this piece and use "AXIS_CVL.gif" for 
the image. </p>
 
<p><a name="play"></a><b>During Play</b> </p>
 
<p>When loading a game or starting a new game, the user will be prompted
for which side he wants to play.&nbsp; Once a side is taken, no other player
may take that side until the original player hits the "Retire" button in
the controls window.&nbsp; During pay, when the USA player places a counter
on the map, the refereee should place a corresponding invisible counter in
the IJN map, and vice versa.&nbsp; As the USA player moves his counters,
the referee should move the corresponding counters on the IJN map.&nbsp;
At the appropriate time, the referee can reveal USA counters on the IJN map,
or hide them again.&nbsp; The two players will see only their own map, with 
only those opposing counters that the referee has revealed. <br>
