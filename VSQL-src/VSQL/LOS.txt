--Checking LOS -- adopted from VASL -- 7/21/03

EDITOR'S NOTE:  We have found that using the automatic LOS
checking sometimes gives erroneous results.  What may look clear
to you may look blocked to the game, or vice versa.  As always,
your judgement is best.

    VSQL 3.0 features automatic LOS checking (ported from VASL),
courtesy of David Sullivan.  LOS checking works on single boards,
cropped boards, or across multiple boards.  However, LOS does
not account for overlays or terrain transformations (e.g. Grain
out of season) at this time.  You may enable or disable LOS checking
in the "LOS" tab of the preferences.

   After pressing the LOS button, left click the mouse in any hex (the
"source" hex) and drag the mouse to any other hex (the "target" hex)
to check the LOS. You may select the highest location in a hex by
holding the control key (Ctrl) down when clicking or dragging the
mouse. If the mouse pointer is not in the center of a hex, the LOS
will be checked to/from the nearest hex spine (The 'Snap thread to
grid' preference is ignored when LOS checking is enabled). The last
LOS checked remains displayed on the screen as long as VASL is in LOS
mode. Note that if the 'Retain LOS-hindrance counters' preference is
yes (checked), the hindrance counters that remain on the screen during
the LOS check WILL affect the results.

Note too that VSQL has enabled LOS using AFV's.  The vehicles will
stay on the map when you check LOS.  The upside:  You can now determine
if the LOS thread crosses the vehicle outline to see if a shot is
blocked or not.  The downside:  The module shows a "hindrance" even
if the thread crosses the counter itself (not the drawing).  This is
due to the coding from VASL.  However, it is still useful if you use
the LOS thread to determine shots.

The LOS thread uses three different colors: a basic thread color, a
hindrance color, and a blocked color, all of which are customizable in
the Edit Properties dialog. The LOS thread starts with the basic
color, indicating a clear LOS, changes to the hindrance color at the
point of the first hindrance, and then changes to the blocked color at
the point where the LOS is blocked.

If the "Verbose LOS Mode" preference box is checked, text messages
closest to the source and target locations will display the name and
elevation of the locations. A second text message, near the target
location, will display the range and the result of the LOS check.  If
the LOS is clear, but hindrances where detected, the number of
hindrances will be given. If the LOS is blocked, the hex where it is
blocked and the reason will be shown.

While the LOS is visible, you may move the source and target locations
up and down within the hex using these keystrokes:

Keystroke         Moves
---------         -----
Up arrow          Move the target location up
Down arrow        Move the target location down
Ctrl+Up arrow     Move the source location up
Ctrl+Down arrow   Move the source location down

If no locations exist above or below the current one, the keystroke is
ignored.
