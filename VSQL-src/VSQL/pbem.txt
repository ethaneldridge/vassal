NOTES:

1. The goal of this sequence of play is to assure that each side has full ownership of all the decisions and actions of his/her own forces. If an internet dice-roller is used, usual procedure is for the firing player to summarize all attacks and results within the mailing.

2. (Pregame) Any activities that would have been ordered prior to the first mailing must be provided as a special PREGAME ORDER.

3. The phasing player is given the option to do vehicle movement in impulses, if this is desired. Impulses permit subsequent actions based upon the reaction of the defense to earlier movement.

4. (Warning) Overruns must be specified during FIRST MAILING (A8) but not resolved until LAST MAILING (C1) so that defender has a chance to defensive fire without the pre-knowledge of the result.

5. Three numbering schemes that players have used:
  * 1.1-1.3 (three mailings of first player turn in turn #1, 1.4-1.6 (three mailings of second player turn in turn #1).
  * 1a.rpm/def/end (three mailings of first player turn in turn #1), 1b.rpm/def/end (three mailings of second player turn in turn #1).
  * R/G/A (force identification), a/b/c (for three mailings of specified force's player turn.

6. Email Turn syntax. There are many ways to do this, and each player will tend to develop his/her own as you play more games. Important issue is to provide all of the information that your opponent needs to interpret your text, which should include: current location, movement route (perhaps MF and MP expended), target for firing (range is helpful to minimize the effect of typos), firepower/basic to hit numbers, all applicable DRMs to be applied.

A comment about VASL (Virtual ASL) Java-based gaming assistant:
When Using VASL for email play, this sequence of play can work well. This game assistant has numerous advantages, including keeping unit location records and making available the opportunity to play interactively over the internet. VASL also has an internal pseudo-random number generator, which can speed play if its use is acceptable to both players. If using VASL software interactively, one should get agreement on announced attacks before requesting a dice roll and all Morale Check rolls should be done by the player owning the units.
