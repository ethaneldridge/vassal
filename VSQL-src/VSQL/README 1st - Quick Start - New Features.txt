QUICK START
-- Download VASSAL.  You can get the latest VASSAL engine at 
www.vassalengine.org ... there is a "download" section there.
-- Download this module.  The module will be posted at www.vassalengine.org ... 
there will be a link in the "modules" section for VSQL.  The file will be a .ZIP 
file.  Within it is some documentation and the module itself.
-- Place the VSQL.mod file in the directory you want to store your module.  
Usually, I create a "modules" directory as a sub-directory to VASSAL, and store 
my modules there.

NEW FEATURES:
Here is a list of "new features".  Let me first encourage you just to explore 
around.  You never know what you'll learn just by clicking!

-- GENERAL:
-- Right Click on counters to show a drop-down menu of that counter's features:
-- Counters, with very few exceptions, are listed Alphabetically or Numerically.
-- Cross of Iron counter set has been added!

-- CHARTS:
-- Many charts are loaded, including the Quick Reference Charts.  You can look 
at them by going to the Charts menu on the Controls window, or hitting "F5".  
They are tabbed by module, and include the most useful.  Not all game charts are 
represented.

-- LOS
-- Vehicles, rubble, and certain other terrain-modifying counters will remain 
"on board" when you check LOS (F10).  Now, when you draw your LOS lines, you can 
see if the line crosses the outline of the vehicle to determine if LOS is 
blocked.

-- VEHICLES
-- There are two menus for vehicles:  SL and COI.  Since the counters are so 
different, we made two tabs depending on which game you are using.
-- Vehicles wrecks rotate all six directions, and rotate "with" the vehicle.  
So, if you're facing southwest when you get blown up, your wreck will be 
southwest too.
-- Vehicles remain on board when you do LOS checks.
-- Ctrl-B will toggle button-up/CE
-- Ctrl-W will toggle Stun, +1 TH, withdraw.  Should only work if the vehicle 
was CE.
-- Vehicle turrets are added, similar to VASL.  Use ctrl-a/s to rotate.
-- Vehicle Info is added for most vehicles.  Just hit Ctrl-I (or select the 
counter menu) to see that vehicle's specifics.  The notes are from the armor 
listings.
-- Multiple Variants of certain vehicles are added.  May vehicles had optional 
armament.  We have included them all.  If your vehicle has optional armament, 
follow the appropriate rules, using the rarity factor.  If you get the optional 
armament, drag off the old piece and grab the correct one.

-- GUNS
-- There are two menus for Guns:  SL and COI.  Since the counters are so 
different, we made two tabs depending on which game you are using.
-- Gun malfunction counters rotate all six directions, and rotate "with" the 
gun.  So, if you're facing southwest when you break your gun, your malfunctioned 
gun will be southwest too.
-- Gun Info is added for most guns.  Just hit Ctrl-I (or select the counter 
menu) to see that vehicle's specifics.  The notes are from the armor listings.
-- Note:  The German 88L and 88LL AA guns can be limbered.  You can use "U" to 
limber/unlimber, in addition to "B" to break/fix a gun.

-- INFANTRY
-- Infantry now have special menu commands to show Berserk (ctrl-B), or Crew 
Exhausted (Ctrl-X).  SS also have berserk capability.
-- When infantry break, a DM counter will show on top.  The DM has three 
classifications depending on the unit that broke:  DM+4 (standard), DM+2 (SS), 
or "Can Route" (Americans).

-- CONCEALMENT
-- When you use the Conceal counter menu (ctrl-c), it will conceal the stack and 
place an appropriate concealment counter on it.
-- Concealment counters can be found under the Units\(nationality)\Concealment 
menu.

-- PLC
-- There is a separate PLC menu, which includes a blank PLC, a blank Hero, and 
several "named" PLC counters.  To show your Leader's rating, use the "change 
label" (ctrl-L) command.

-- BASIC COUNTERS
-- The "twelve most often used counters" (in the team's opinion) is found on the 
Basic menu.  You can easily navigate to these counters by clicking on the Basic 
tab.
-- Prep/DF/AF counters are now separate.
-- New TI and CX counters for easy playability.
-- Track counter "doesn't stack", so when troops move through a "track"ed hex, 
the track counter won't tow with them.
-- Smoke now has several Nationalities available.  Use the "Nationality" counter 
menu, or ctrl-N, to change it.
-- Acquisition has two colors, red and blue, just for playability.  Use select 
the color option on the counter (ctrl-C) to change it.

-- INFO COUNTERS
-- Info counters are grouped according to "logical" subjects, and are 
alphabetical within that subject.
-- If the counter has information on the back, like planes, that table also 
appears on the back of the counter!
-- Many info counters have two or more "sides".  Use the counter's menu to help 
you out.  The most often command is to "flip" (ctrl-F).
-- OBA now is in country colors.  To toggle through AR/SR/FFE, use 
increase/decrease (ctrl-x/z) to go up/down in intensity.
-- OBA Red/Blue are included "just because".  They may get deleted in a future 
version, but for now, they stay.
-- Locations counters are mostly not stackable ... meaning that they won't 
follow your counters around.  They can be moved, but not with a stack.
-- Overlays have their own menu.  Use the "Draggable Overlays" option from the 
Controls window.
-- Mines, in the fortification menu, can be increased/decreased using ctrl-x/z.
-- "Control" counters can be used to help identify Victory conditions/hexes (The 
"V"), who currently "owns" a hex/building, or a user labeled counter.  The user-
labeled counter is simply a transparent counter that you can add text to.
-- Transport contains Calvary horses, Aircraft, or parachutes.

-- F-KEYS
-- F-keys are shortcut keys to help out

CONTROL WINDOW MENU COMMANDS:
-- New Game:  Starts a New Game.  If you get a "board error", make sure you 
mapped the right board directory in the "preferences" menu.
-- Load Game:  Loads a game.  The game loading time will vary depending on the 
speed of your computer and the complexity of the game.
-- Save Game:  Saves a game file.
-- Close Game:  Closes the current game.  If you have made changes since the 
last save, VASSAL will prompt you if you want to save it or not.
-- Begin Logfile:  Start a "log" of every move you make.  Note, to keep the log, 
you actually must "End" it.
-- End Logfile:  Ends the log you started and writes it.  This is the file you 
will probably send to your opponent.
-- Edit Preferences:  See the section on "preferences" below
-- Quit:  Quits VSQL.  But why would you want to do that?
-- Help:  Various help files, FAQ, credits, etc. we've compiled.


*****
PREFERENCES
The preferences menu can be configured.  Here is some help for the options:
-- PERSONAL
-- Name:  Your "game name".  This is what will be printed in logs, or shown on 
the server.
-- Password:  Your "password".  The password is used to identify you as the 
owner of hidden or concealed pieces.  You'll never have to type it in game.
--
-- SOUNDS
-- These are the sounds used if you log into the server.  SUGGEST that you
leave the default sounds, although you may change them to any sound that
you choose.
--
-- CHAT WINDOW
-- This menu is for the "chat window" where you see dice rolls and type
information in-game.  You can change the colors or fonts of specific
messages.  The default font is SansSerif 12.  Default game messages are
pink, System messages are light grey, "My text" messages are dark grey, 
and Other's Text Messages are black.  Change them to anything that looks
good to you.
--
-- GENERAL
-- Center On Opponent's Moves:  SUGGEST CHECKED:  During the logfile play, if 
this is checked, the board will "re-center" on your opponent's pieces as they 
move, helping to know exactly where things are moving.  Unchecked, the board 
remains stationary, meaning, you may not be able to see pieces that are moving 
off of the visible screen.
-- Auto-Report Moves:  SUGGEST CHECKED:  As you move pieces, an entry is written 
in the main window.  If you want that listed, leave it on.  If you don't want it 
listed, and thus your opponent not to see anything, uncheck it.
-- Let Opponent Unconceal My Units:  SUGGEST UNCHECKED:  Unchecked:  Your 
opponent will only see a stack of "?" on your concealed counters.  Checked:  
They can inspect the stack just like you can.
-- Use combined application window:  SUGGEST either preference.  When
checked, there will only be one VSQL window, with all sub-windows automatically
docked to the main window.  You will not be able to move the windows around,
but you can  resize them.  If UNCHECKED, all windows are undocked and can be
moved around.  This will, however, make several taskbar buttons appear on
Windows XP units.
-- Smooth image scaling:  SUGGEST CHECKED:  Makes graphics look nicer.
-- Board Directory:  The directory you have your boards stored in.
-- Use Arrow Keys To Scroll:  SUGGEST UNCHECKED:  When checked, the arrow keys 
will scroll your map.  Unchecked, and you need to use your mouse.  Note that you 
can always "right-click" in a map hex and the board will move in that direction.
-- Use CTRL-space to view stack details:  SUGGEST UNCHECKED:  Changes whether
you need to use the control-space to view the details of a stack or not.
-- Delay before popup display (ms):  SUGGEST 700.  This is the delay when
you mouse-over a stack before the contents are displayed.
--
-- LOS
-- Retain LOS-hindrance Counters:  SUGGEST CHECKED:  When unchecked, and you 
check LOS (F10), all map counters will temporarily disappear from the map.  If 
checked, certain counters (vehicles, rubble, etc) that can affect LOS, will 
remain on the map.
-- Snap Thread to Grid:  SUGGEST CHECKED:  If checked, the LOS thread will 
always center on a hex or hex intersection.  If unchecked, the LOS can roam 
freely.
-- Thread Color:  SUGGEST DEFAULT:  self explanatory.
-- Enable LOS Checking:  SUGGEST UNCHECKED:  This turns on the special LOS 
checking features of VASL/VSQL, where the LOS will attempt to determine if a LOS 
is blocked or not.  We have found some errors, so use it with caution.  The 
original program was written with ASL rules in mind.
-- Hindrance Thread Color:  SUGGEST DEFAULT:  Color of the LOS thread if the 
routine thinks the LOS is "Hindered" (ASL rule).
-- Blocked Thread Color:  SUGGEST DEFAULT:  Color of the LOS thread if the 
routine thinks the LOS is Blocked (using ASL rules).
-- Verbose LOS mode:  SUGGEST DEFAULT:  If checked, and if you have "Enable LOS 
Checking", VASSAL will tell you why it thinks a LOS is blocked/hindered.
--
-- VSQL
-- Snap Counters to Hex Grid Center Only?  SUGGEST CHECKED:  This will put
all counters ONLY into the center of the hex.  Note, that if you also want
to allow counters to be put onto the hex intersections, you can uncheck.
-- Rule Level:  Defaults to SL.  This is for future expansion modules.
--
-- INTERNET DIE ROLLER
-- Email results?  If this is checked, results of each dice roll (using the
roller) will be emailed to you and your opponent.
-- Address book:  Place to put your favorite email opponent addresses.  Note,
they must be ADDed before they are saved.
-- Primary Email:  This is YOUR email address.
-- Secondary Email:  This is the CURRENT opponent.  This must be changed
every time you are playing a different opponent, otherwise, the emailed
rolls will go to the wrong place.
-- Put multiple rolls into a single email:  DEFAULT CHECKED.  Allows you
to have SEVERAL rolls in one email.  I think this is a nicer interface to use,
and allows flexibility in description of the roles.  Play with a couple
of test rolls to determine your preference.
-- NATIONALITY COLORS
-- Leave the colors default.  This menu sets the color of the concealment '?' 
that is displayed on your view of your concealed counters.
