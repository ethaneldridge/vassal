Counter Hotkeys -- April, 2005

Add counters by dragging them from the toolbar at the top of the map.

Right-click to expand a stack in order to view its contents.
(Mac users hold down the apple key.)  Right-click again to return it
to compacted form.

Mouse-over a stack will also show a stack without expanding it

Click and drag stacks to move them, or individual counters
from an expanded stack.  Shift-click to select multiple counters to move.

Lasso several stacks at once by drawing a box around them with the left-
mouse button.  NOTE:  You must use keyboard commands to affect all
pieces.

Click on a counter to select it.  (It will be drawn with a thick
black border.)   Then use these commands to alter the counter:

up-arrow	move to top of stack
down-arrow	move to bottom of stack

It is legal for you to manipulate counters belonging to your
opponent.  Honor system applies. 

Your own concealed units are drawn with a "?" in the upper
left corner.  Your opponent's concealed units look like dummies to
you.  Your own HIP units are drawn at faded, against
a white background.  Your opponent's HIP units are invisible to you.
