WHY DOES THE MAP WINDOW OPEN UP SO LARGE?
This seems to be a windows issue.  Occasionally, when you open a game, the map 
window will open unzoomed, but full screen.  I just resize the map.

HOW DO I FIND OUT WHAT A COUNTER CAN "DO"?
Right click on the specific counter when on the map board.  You'll get a drop
down list that shows "special" commands for that specific counter.  Many will
automatically add a piece to the board for convenience (like a DM counter when
a squad breaks).

HOW DO I EXPAND MY STACK?
To expand your stack, double-click on it!  Right clicking on a stack will show 
the selected *unit* properties.

CAN I SEE WHAT IS IN A STACK WITHOUT DOUBLE-CLICKING?
Just mouse-over the stack, and you should see the contents.  The "delay time"
to see the contents is a preference that can be changed.

HOW DO I SCROLL THE MAP?
The map window can be scrolled several ways.  First, you can use the drag bars 
at the right or the bottom of the map window.  Second, you can right-click on 
any open area on the map.  The map will recenter in that direction.  Third, you 
can use the arrow keys to scroll if you have that option set in "file\edit 
preferences\general\use arrow key to scroll."  Finally, if you have selected and 
are "holding" a piece (i.e. left-click and holding), you can drag a piece and it 
will scroll the map too.

I CANNOT SEEM TO SELECT/MOVE A PARTICULAR PIECE!
Certain pieces are marked "can not be moved."  These might be roadblocks, wire, 
control/ownership markers, etc.  To move or do anything with these pieces, 
shift-leftclick them to select them.  To see that piece's drop-down menu, shift-
leftclick to select the piece, then shift-right click to see the menu.

WHEN I LOOK AT THE COUNTERS MENU, I CAN SEE THE LIST OF COUNTERS, BUT I CANNOT 
SEE ANY COUNTER GRAPHICS!  WHERE DID THE GRAPHICS GO IN THE LIST?
There is a vertical bar that you can move left-right to resize the sub-windows 
in the counter menu.  The counter should be on the left, and the list of 
counters for that counter type on the right.

WHERE DID THE "CONCEALMENT" COUNTERS GO?
The concealment counters are on their own sub menu within a particular country.  
We put them there to keep from having to repeat the same counter, and making it 
a "one-stop shopping" place to find concealment and blanks.

WHAT IS THIS "INFO" THINGY ON COUNTERS?  (CTRL-I)
This is a new feature.  Many counters have special information about them, 
especially vehicles.  For instance, perhaps a vehicle was not capable of 
intensive fire, or was not equipped with a radio.  We have put that in the 
"Info" tag.  Just press ctrl-I to see if there is special information.  The info 
was pulled from the vehicle tables at the back of the manual.

WHY ARE THERE SL VEHICLES AND COI+ VEHICLE TABS?
Since the counters look and function very differently, we made two tabs for the 
vehicles and guns.  SL vehicles do not have turrets, and are graphically 
different.  COI adds turret capability to those vehicles that have turrets, plus 
have the correct COI+ graphic.  When we add COD, those vehicles will also go 
into the COI+ tab since COD just ADDS them, not replaces them.

WHY ARE THERE SOME COUNTERS THAT HAVE AN SL OR COI+ DESIGNATION?
Most counters will work for all gamettes.  However, a "few" do not.  An example 
is the German panzerfaust.  In SL, there was only one panzerfaust.  In COI, 
there are several.  Rather than making a separate menu system all together, we 
put everything in one menu.  For the few counters that had replacements like 
these, we listed them in the same list.  The exception to this is the Vehicles 
and Guns.

CAN I SEE WHERE A COUNTER MOVED ON THE BOARD?
Hit ctrl-T.  You will see where the counter moved that phase.  If it is a
vehicle, an "arrow" will indicate the direction of the covered arc of that
vehicle when it initially entered the hex.

WHY DO I NEED A PASSWORD?
Passwords allow you to Hide your counters/notes (HIP), or conceal stacks so your 
opponent cannot inspect them.  Your opponent can never see your HIP units, but 
they can unconceal your units if you let them by setting the option in 
"File\edit preferences\general\let opponent unconceal my units."

WHY DON'T MY PIECES SHOW THE "MOVED" TAG?
Did you remember to set the preference in "file\edit preferences\general\mark 
moved pieces"?

WHY DON'T MY UNITS REPORT THEIR MOVEMENT IN THE CHAT WINDOW?
Did you remember to set the preference in "file\edit preferences\general\auto-
report moves"?

CAN I REPLAY/LOAD GAMES FROM VASL3.X?  VSQL 1.x?
Sorry, no.  VSQL3.0 is backward compatable to version 2.0 and up only.  Same 
answer for VSQL 1.x.

IT TAKES GAMES A LONG TIME TO LOAD.  WHY?
If you are on a slower machine, loading a game with multiple mapboards, and 
limited RAM, it will take a while to load if you are using the "enable LOS 
checking" option.  If this option is turned on, the game loads quite a bit of 
LOS data into RAM to help you in determining if a shot is blocked or not.  To 
load faster, disable this function in "file\edit preferences\LOS\enable LOS 
checking."  You still can check LOS, but you will not get feedback as to whether 
VASSAL thinks LOS is blocked or not.

I'M GETTING "OUT OF MEMORY" ERRORS!
If you are running the Stand-alone version of VSQL, make sure you are running the ‘vsql.bat’ file and not the ‘runVSQL.jar’ file. The Webstart version of VSQL should already be configured to use 256Mb of memory.

I SEE A PROBLEM!  A COUNTER IS MISSING/WRONG/MISLABELED/DOESN'T WORK RIGHT/ETC.!
Although we strive for perfection, even perfectionists make mistakes.  Please 
drop an email to vsql@wargameacademy.org and we'll look into it.

SO WHO ARE BRANDI AND ROMAN ANYWAY?
Brandi and Roman are Jay Yanek's standard poodles.  They are internationally 
certified "therapy animals," meaning they are certified to visit hospitals, 
nursing homes, etc. and bring therapy to people.  Therapy can be either physical 
therapy (retrieving a ball that a patient throws), or just being loved by a 
patient that has been in the hospital for an extended period of time.  To learn 
more about my therapy animals, visit www.deltasociety.org
