VSQL is a project based on the Virtual ADVANCED SQUAD LEADER 
(VASL) module and the VASSAL engine Java applications authored by 
Rodney Kinney.  With Rodney's help, the SQUAD LEADER module 
ported the similarities of maps and module components as a basis 
for VSQL.  The VSQL team would like to thank Rodney and the rest 
of the VASL team for help and support with the project. VSQL 
version 2.5 adds all the functionality to play CROSS OF IRON to 
the module.

The project also included a significant amount of additional work 
to make it viable for Squad Leader (SL/COI/COD/GIA) play. Those 
include endless hours by Dennis Jorgenson for the hand-drawn 
counter design for both the SL and COI gamettes, and the original 
SL interface for VSQL.  Jay Yanek has redesigned the module, 
built the SL and COI counters and menu system, and acted as team 
cheerleader, driving the project along.  Jay’s efforts were 
instrumental towards accelerating project completion.  
Brent Easton was the key driver for version 3.0.  His skill in
java programming and bringing the version 3.0 team was essential.
Bill Thomson served Program Manager and a key consultant in the 
project definition, design and organizing player input to define 
VSQL requirements to meet player expectation.

Other significant contributions, including earlier version 
integration, suggestions and testing; from Jeff Thorpe, Pete 
Pollard, Alan Yngve, and Jay White are greatly appreciated.  
Members of the Squad Leader Email list community and those 
actively playing SQL using the VASL 3.02 program were solicited 
to help define a VSQL project scope with functionality tailored 
for SQL (COI, COD, GIA included) play.  The value versus work 
required to instill items from this wish list were reviews for 
prioritization.  The alpha and beta playtest groups of earlier 
VSQL versions submitted additional input.  All of these earlier 
efforts influenced the VASSAL Engine, VSQL and VASL as they 
currently appear.    

Version 2.5 Beta Testing help was provided by John Blazel, Dennis 
Jorgenson, Pete Pollard, Scott Powers, Chris Stewart, Joe Thomas, 
Bill Thomson, Jay White, Jay Yanek, and Alan Yngve.  Thanks to 
their time to help work out the final issues and give improvement 
suggestions.

Version 3.0 Beta Testing help was provided by Bronson Barnhart,
David Carter, Brent Easton, Dennis Jorgenson, Timothy St. Jean,
Bill Skulley, Bill Thomson, Jay Yanek, Alan Yngve.  Their work
helped to speed delivery of the new stand-alone version.

Several participants have made significant contribution.  In 
appreciation of these combined contributions, The VSQL project 
team would like to recognize the follow as ‘plank’ owners.  Named 
Personal Leader Counters (PLC) will be included in this or future 
VSQL modules (five were available at release time). Additional 
recognition is made to the entire list of participants in the 
project scope, survey, alpha, beta and final checkout efforts:
