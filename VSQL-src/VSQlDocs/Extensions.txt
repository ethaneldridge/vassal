USING VSQL EXTENSIONS

VSQL 3.0 is a 'stabilised' version, meaning that it will not be upgraded 
again for some time, but this does not mean that devlopment within the 
VSQL has finished. 

VASSAL allows existing modules to be extended by using 'mini-modules' 
called Extensions that add extra maps, counters and other resources to 
an existing module. 

Extensions currently being developed include:

 - Crescendo of Doom counterset
 - GI: Anvil of Victory counterset
 - Additional Personal Leader Counters

These extensions will be distributed via the VSQL web page at the VASSALEngine 
web site.

Extensions are distributed with a '.mdx' suffix, to distinguish them from 
modules, which normally have a '.mod' suffix.

An extension is installed by copying it to the directory called 'vsql_ext' 
contains in the same directory as the 'vsql.mod' module file your are loading 
to run VSQL.

If you are using the stand-alone VSQL 3.0 package, this is easy. The vsql.mod 
file and a pre-created vsql_ext directory exist within the zip package and 
are created in the folder where you unzip the package. 

If you are using the Webstart version of VSQL 3.0, the situation is a little 
more complicated. The vsql_ext directory must be created in the folder where 
you installed the VASSAL documentation the first time you installed VASSAL. 
You may need to search your disk for the 'Tutorial' and 'ReferenceManual' 
folders.
