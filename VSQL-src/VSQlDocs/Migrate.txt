--For users of VASL 3.0 (using the old VASL engine)

    Modules are NOT compatable.  Unfortunately, since counters
were completely renamed, you will NOT be able to replay or load VASL
3.0 games into VSQL.
    NOTE:  THE VASL 3.0 SERVER IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE.  THE ONLY
           SERVER AVAILABLE IS FOR VASSAL GAMES.

--For users of VSQL *PRIOR* to version 2.0 (using VASSAL)

    Modules are NOT compatable with VSQL 2.0 or greater, since the
counters were completely renamed when the game was rebuilt.  You
will NOT be able to replay or load VSQL pre-2.0 games into VSQL
2.0 or greater.

--For users of VSQL 2.0 and greater (using VASSAL)

    Modules ARE compatable.  You will get a version alert; however, you
should still be able to play the logfile.  You may need to 


--GENERAL NOTES:

    VSQL 2.x offers many obvious improvements over VASL 3.0 and pre-VSQL
2.0, and a few things that may take getting used to.

   Muscle retraining alert: Right-clicking no longer expands
stacks.  Right-clicking brings up a popup menu with commands for that
counter.  Stacks are expanded by double-clicking on them.

    You can also right-click in the counters window to manipulate
counters before dragging them onto the map.

    The "Change ownership" command is gone.  In effect, units are
owned by the player that conceals them.  Also note the preferences
setting that allows you to control whether your opponent can unconceal
your units during a game.

    VASL 4.0 and 3.0 use different servers.  You can't connect to
3.0's server with 4.0 or vice versa.
