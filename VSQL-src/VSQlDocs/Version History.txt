-- Changed "Can be invisible" trait on most Info counters to have the 
background color be white instead of transparent.  Helps to see counters better 
on the board.
-- Added SL and COI Quick Reference Cards to the Charts menu.  Also added 
misc. charts.
-- Removed "moved" attribute from nearly all Info counters.
-- Added "CX" option to each infantry unit.  Now ctrl-X will place a CX counter 
on that unit (similar functionality as the DM counter).
-- Removed some reporting keys from counters that did not need it ('A' and 'S' 
were common ones).
-- Changed menu system by pulling out the "Basic" menu and making it its own 
top-level. Should make it easier for users to get to repeat counters quickly.

-- Updated turret counters to new graphics.
-- Added overlays for grain, marsh, rubble (stone & wood), woods, and water.

Replaced with "marker/location" for all of these counters.  Should help with 
playability.
-- Blank counters text labels have been center justified in all directions.  Text 
will now draw in the center of the counter vs. the top.
-- Shortened many counter names per beta input.  Should reduce the "verbage" 
that shows up on the info window during play.  Along this line, abbreviated:  
Partisan with 'p', Inexperienced with 'i'.  SS names will remain with the 'ss' 
suffix.
-- Updated several "info" counters with the correct "can be marked moved" 
attribute.  VASL/VSQL uses a custom attribute, not the standard one that 
comes with VASSAL.
-- Enabled the transparent stacking option in "map window\stacking 
options\color of pieces when not expanded".  Set transparent per instructions.  
Now when pieces are stacked and not expanded, you can see portions of the 
lower pieces.
-- Updated American, German, Russian FFE counters.  Left the Blue/Red OBA 
counters in the set for now.
-- Added new ASLCommandEncoder.class file to the \VASL\build\module 
section (via Rodney Kinney).  This .class will allow us to toggle the 
Nationality function so it does not appear on the Preferences menu.  Currently, 
the flag in the buildfile is not set.  Rodney needs to work out a bug.
-- Adjusted all MMC/SMC counters "place marker" attribute to have the DM 
marker defined properly.  Now the DM placed by these counters will function 
the same as the DM on the Basic menu.
-- Added 2.0.3 American AT counters to images file for compatibility.
-- Updated Prep/DF/AF counters per user input.  Prep/AF are white.  DF is gray.  
Also changed counter layout for Prep to conform to template.
-- Removed several redundant counters from the original COI game build.  
These counters were when the vehicle rotation was previously defined as 
VCA #1 was SE instead of NE.
-- Removed multiple obsolete counters not used from buildfile and images 
directory.
-- Does Not Stack:  Removed the "DNS" attribute from the following counters.  
Substituted the Marker/Location attribute:  Smoke, Fire (both), Rubble, AR, 
Starshell, Aircraft (all).
-- Added CE/Stun/+1TH/Withdraw to all vehicles.  All vehicles can now 
button/unbutton (ctrl-b), and cycle through the stun list if needed (ctrl-w).
-- Compatibility exists backward to version 2.0.  Future expansions will be 
compatible with this module.
-- Added COI counterset (provided by Dennis Jorgenson).  New counterset does 
not use the "nationality" functionality any more.  This can be ignored on the 
preferences menu (this menu will be removed in a future version).
-- All vehicle/gun wrecks/malfunctions now rotate along all six directions.
-- Added "DM +2" counter for SS units (similar functionality to the American 
"Can Route" counter).  DM+2 and "Can Route" are flips of the basic DM 
counter.
-- Added appropriate counters from the VASL 4.10 module which enhance 
VSQL.  (e.g.  fanatic, No ammo/cannister/etc, fortified building, etc.)

-- Separated SL and COI  vehicles and guns into separate menus for each 
country via tab.

available.  COD and GI functionality will be added at a later date.
-- Changed the "Remove" menu on the Map window to better reflect gameplay.
-- Changed the Defensive Fire counter to a gray background to facilitate easy 
spotting.
-- Added help menus, credits, etc. to the "help" tab.
-- All vehicles now will remain as "hindrances" when checking LOS (if that 
option is chosen on the preferences menu.  Now you will be able to see if the 
LOS thread crosses the vehicle silhouette.
-- Counters like the "level" counter added the Marker attribute with the 
"Location" flag to allow units to stack both above or below the counter.  
Moving units through this type of counter will no longer drag the counter with 
the stack.  To move these special counters if the counter if it is part of a stack, 
expand the stack then drag the counter out.
-- Reorganized attributes on all counters to make them consistent.
-- Reorganized menus to make them fit the new counterset.
-- Revamped module to include latest VASSAL improvements.
-- Updated .class code to be consistent with the VASL series.
-- Added "template" text file to the beta-distribution package.  To be used so 
future authors can understand how various genres of pieces are built.
