PREFERENCES
The preferences menu can be configured.  Here is some help for the options:

PERSONAL
--------

- Name:  Your "game name".  This is what will be printed in logs, or shown on 
the server.

- Password:  Your "password".  The password is used to identify you as the 
owner of hidden or concealed pieces.  You'll never have to type it in game.
WARNING - If you change your password during a game, you will not be able to 
see any of your hidden or concealed units.

SOUNDS
------

- These are the sounds used if you log into the server.  SUGGEST that you
leave the default sounds, although you may change them to any sound that
you choose.

CHAT WINDOW
-----------

- This menu is for the "chat window" where you see dice rolls and type
information in-game.  You can change the colors or fonts of specific
messages.  The default font is SansSerif 12.  Default game messages are
pink, System messages are light grey, "My text" messages are dark grey, 
and Other's Text Messages are black.  Change them to anything that looks
good to you.

GENERAL
-------

- Auto-Report Moves:  SUGGEST CHECKED.  
As you move pieces, an entry is written in the main window.  If you want that 
listed, leave it on.  If you don't want it listed, and thus your opponent not 
to see anything, uncheck it.

- Center On Opponent's Moves:  SUGGEST CHECKED. 
During the logfile play, if this is checked, the board will "re-center" on your
opponent's pieces as they move, helping to know exactly where things are moving.  
Unchecked, the board remains stationary, meaning, you may not be able to see 
pieces that are moving off of the visible screen.

- Let Opponent Unconceal My Units:  SUGGEST UNCHECKED.  
Your opponent will only see a stack of "?" on your concealed counters.  If you 
leave this option checked, your opponent can inspect the stack just like you can.

-- Use combined application window:  SUGGEST either preference.  
When checked, there will only be one VSQL window, with all sub-windows automatically
docked to the main window.  You will not be able to move the windows around,
but you can  resize them.  If UNCHECKED, all windows are undocked and can be
moved around.  This will, however, make several taskbar buttons appear on
Windows XP units.

- Smooth image scaling:  SUGGEST CHECKED. 
Makes graphics look nicer.

- Board Directory:  The directory you have your VASL/VSQL boards stored in.

- Use Arrow Keys To Scroll:  SUGGEST UNCHECKED.
When checked, the arrow keys will scroll your map.  Unchecked, and you need to 
use your mouse.  Note that you can always "right-click" in a map hex and the 
board will move in that direction.

- Use CTRL-space to view stack details:  SUGGEST UNCHECKED.  
When unchecked, a popup window will appear automatically whenever you hold the
mouse still over a stack. If you leave this option checked, you need to press
the control and space keys together to view a stacks contents.

- Delay before popup display (ms):  SUGGEST 700.  
This is the delay when you mouse-over a stack before the contents are displayed.

LOS
---

- Retain LOS-hindrance Counters:  SUGGEST CHECKED.
When unchecked, and you check LOS (F10), all map counters will temporarily 
disappear from the map.  If checked, certain counters (vehicles, rubble, etc) 
that can affect LOS, will remain on the map.

- Snap Thread to Grid:  SUGGEST CHECKED.  
If checked, the LOS thread will always center on a hex or hex intersection.  
If unchecked, the LOS can roam freely.

- Thread Color:  SUGGEST DEFAULT. 
Self explanatory.

- Enable LOS Checking:  SUGGEST UNCHECKED.  
This turns on the special LOS checking features of VSQL, where the LOS will 
attempt to determine if a LOS is blocked or not.  We have found some errors, so 
use it with caution.

- Hindrance Thread Color:  SUGGEST DEFAULT.  
Color of the LOS thread if the routine thinks the LOS is "Hindered" (ASL rule).

- Blocked Thread Color:  SUGGEST DEFAULT.  
Color of the LOS thread if the routine thinks the LOS is Blocked.

- Verbose LOS mode:  SUGGEST DEFAULT.  
If checked, and if you have "Enable LOS Checking", VASSAL will tell you why it 
thinks a LOS is blocked/hindered.

VSQL
----

- Position all counters in center of hex?  SUGGEST CHECKED:  
Suggested for SL level play. This will put all counters ONLY into the 
center of the hex.  Note, that if you also want to allow counters to be put onto 
the hex edges or intersections for bypass movement (later rule sets), 
you can uncheck.

- Rule Level:  Defaults to SL.  This is for future expansion modules.


 INTERNET DIE ROLLER
- Email results?  If this is checked, results of each dice roll (using the
roller) will be emailed to you and your opponent.

- Address book:  Place to put your favorite email opponent addresses.  Note,
they must be ADDed before they are saved. You can use addresses like 
'Bob Robertson <bob@somewhere.com>' Only the part within the <> angle brackets
will be used for the email address.

- Primary Email:  This is YOUR email address.

- Secondary Email:  This is the CURRENT opponent.  This must be changed
every time you are playing a different opponent, otherwise, the emailed
rolls will go to the wrong place.

- Put multiple rolls into a single email:  SUGGEST CHECKED.  
Allows you to have SEVERAL rolls in one email.  I think this is a nicer interface to use,
and allows flexibility in description of the roles.  Play with a couple
of test rolls to determine your preference.
