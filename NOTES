* URLs for version checking and bug reporting switched to vassalengine.org.
* Starting with this release, all Bug and RFE numbers refer to the ones

For changes prior to 3.1.15, see the change log. For feature changes from 3.0
to 3.1, see the release notes for 3.1.0.

VASSAL has a new User's Guide! You can view the User's Guide by selecting
"User's Guide" from the Help menu in any of VASSAL's components.

The recommended minimum Java version for VASSAL 3.1 has changed. A bug in
versions of Java prior to 1.5.0_08 (a.k.a. Java 5 update 8) prevents some
images from loading properly. We now recommend that anyone using a version
of Java older than 1.5.0_08 upgrade to *at least* 1.5.0_08.

Furthermore, we recommend that Windows users in particular upgrade to at
least Java 1.6.0_21 (a.k.a. Java 6 Update 21), in order to avoid bugs present
in earlier versions of Java. Windows users installing VASSAL 3.1.16 with the
Windows installer will be prompted to update Java if what they have is older
than 1.6.0_22. After upgrading Java on Windows, you must restart your computer
in order for Java programs to work properly.

Please report all bugs, even if they are bugs which you've already reported
against other versions. We take your bug reports very seriously---they're
the reason we're able to find and fix bugs.
