The recommended minimum Java version for VASSAL 3.1 has changed. A bug in
versions of Java prior to 1.5.0_08 (a.k.a. Java 5 update 8) prevents some
images from loading properly. We now recommend that anyone using a version
of Java older than 1.5.0_08 upgrade to *at least* 1.5.0_08.

For Linux and Mac users, this should require no action on your part. Windows
users installing VASSAL 3.1.1 with the Windows installer will be prompted to
update Java if what they have is older than 1.5.0_08.

For feature changes from 3.0 to 3.1, see the release notes for 3.1.0.

Please report all bugs, even if they are bugs which you've already reported
against other versions. We take your bug reports very seriously---they're
the reason we're able to find and fix bugs.
