  This is the source code release for the VASSAL engine.  Usage is
subject to the terms of the Library Gnu Public Licesne (LGPL),
described in the LICENSE.txt file and also available from
http://www.opensource.org.

  The included source code comprises a library, not a complete
standalone application.  The library is used by VASSAL
(http://www.vassalengine.org), which is a standalone application.
VASSAL is freeware, but not Open Source.

  To begin development on your own, you'll need this source code and
an installation of VASSAL.  Include all the .jar files in VASSAL's
"lib" directory in your classpath _except_ Vengine.jar.  Start the
VASSAL application with the org.vassalengine.Main main class.  See
VASSAL's programming tutorial for an overview of how to use the API.

  Enjoy!
